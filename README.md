# SeafoodSharp
A demo application that I use in my talk about C# 11 at a meetup or a conference.

New features of C# 11 I’m showing using this demo app for handling users’ review in (fictional) “Seafood Sharp” restaurant.


# Seafood Sharp Restaurant
Slogan: The Best Seafood Restaurant

A fictional restaurant that I made up. I chose the name “Seafood Sharp” because it’s similar to “C#”, a programming language whose latest version is a topic of my presentation.
